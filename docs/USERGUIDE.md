# i3psycho User Guide

i3psycho is i3 with floating-first behavior: macOS-grade window management on
top of an unmodified i3 core. It is a small patch series (4 patches) on
upstream i3 plus a companion IPC daemon, `psychod`. Everything you know about
i3 still applies: the config language, the IPC protocol, workspaces, marks,
the scratchpad, i3bar, i3status, and your muscle memory.

This guide covers installation, daily use, every new binding and action,
configuration, the exact list of behavior differences from stock i3, and
troubleshooting.

## 1. Installation

### Arch Linux

```
git clone https://github.com/ekruges/i3psycho-wip
cd i3psycho-wip/packaging && ./mkpkgfiles.sh
makepkg -si
```

The package **provides and conflicts with `i3-wm`** (the i3-gaps model): the
patched binary is a drop-in `i3`. Your display manager gets an "i3psycho"
session entry. `psychod` and `psychod-status` land in `/usr/bin`.

### Any distro, manual

```
git clone https://github.com/ekruges/i3psycho-wip && cd i3psycho-wip
./packaging/build-i3psycho.sh          # clones upstream i3, applies patches/, builds
sudo ninja -C i3-build/build install   # installs the patched i3
sudo install -m755 psychod/psychod.py /usr/local/bin/psychod
sudo install -m755 psychod/psychod-status /usr/local/bin/psychod-status
```

Runtime dependencies for psychod: `python3`, `python3-i3ipc`, `xdotool`
(hot corners only).

## 2. Choose your entry path

**Existing i3 user (recommended):** add one line to your i3 config:

```
include /usr/share/i3psycho/psycho.conf
```

That adds float-by-default, the psychod bindings, and the daemon launch.
Your colors, bar, and existing binds are untouched. Delete the line to go
back to stock behavior.

**Fresh install:** use the standalone config:

```
cp /usr/share/i3psycho/psycho.config ~/.config/i3/config
```

It is a complete, commented i3 config: the psycho layer plus the standard
i3 survival kit (terminal, dmenu, workspaces, reload/restart/exit).

## 3. Daily use

| Input | Effect |
|---|---|
| Drag titlebar | Move window (stock i3 behavior) |
| Drag to screen edge | Live snap preview (solid blue); drop to snap. Left/right = halves, top = maximize, corners = quarters |
| `×` titlebar button | Close window |
| `−` titlebar button | Iconify (minimize) to the scratchpad, geometry remembered |
| `+` titlebar button | Fullscreen toggle |
| Double-click titlebar | Fullscreen toggle |
| App's own minimize button | Same as `−` (WM_CHANGE_STATE Iconic is honored) |
| Chip in bar | One per minimized window, right of the workspace buttons: app icon or letter tile, blinks in the urgent color on demand for attention. Click restores in place |
| Hot corner top-left | Expose |
| Hot corner bottom-right | Show desktop |
| `$mod+Left / Right / Up / Down` | Snap left half / right half / maximize / center |
| `$mod+Ctrl+1..4` | Snap to quarter (TL, TR, BL, BR) |
| `$mod+m` / `$mod+Shift+m` | Minimize / restore most recent |
| `$mod+Tab` | Cycle windows, most-recent-first; pause 1.2s to commit |
| `$mod+e` | Expose: all floats in a grid; toggle, click, or cycle to exit |
| `$mod+Shift+d` | Show desktop toggle |
| `$mod+t` | Toggle this window back to tiling. Everything i3 does with tiles still works |

New windows cascade from the top-left like macOS instead of stacking dead
center. Dialogs, splash screens, and notifications are left where the
application puts them. Minimize and restore play the retro outline-box
genie: a hollow rect sliding to and from the chip area, 140ms.

### Configuration directives

All optional, defaults shown; they parse only on the patched i3:

```
psycho_genie_duration 140          # minimize/restore ghost, ms; 0 disables
psycho_titlebar_buttons yes
psycho_double_click_titlebar yes
psycho_snap_edges yes
psycho_snap_margin 10              # px from the edge that triggers the preview
psycho_chips yes                   # minimized-window chips in i3bar
```

Colors need no new directives: buttons and the genie use `client.focused`,
chips use the bar's `inactive_workspace` and `urgent_workspace` classes.

## 4. psychod reference

psychod is a pure IPC client. It never touches X directly (except the
optional hot-corner pointer poll via xdotool), so it can never crash the
window manager. If it dies, i3 keeps running; `exec_always` restarts it on
the next config reload, and a `flock` guard prevents duplicates. It
reconnects automatically when i3 restarts in place.

### Actions

Trigger from a keybinding (`bindsym ... nop psycho:<action>`) or from
scripts (`i3-msg -t send_tick psycho:<action>`):

| Action | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `psycho:snap:left\|right\|max\|center\|tl\|tr\|bl\|br` | Snap focused window to exact workarea region |
| `psycho:min` | Minimize focused window, remember geometry |
| `psycho:restore` | Restore most recently minimized |
| `psycho:restore:<con_id>` | Restore a specific window (used by the bar chips) |
| `psycho:cycle` | Walk the MRU window stack |
| `psycho:expose` | Toggle the expose grid on the focused workspace |
| `psycho:showdesktop` | Toggle all floats on the workspace to/from the scratchpad |

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--cascade-step N` | 30 | px offset between cascaded spawns |
| `--edge-margin N` | 25 | px beyond the workarea edge that triggers poll-based drop-snap |
| `--drop-debounce S` | 0.25 | seconds a moved window must rest before snapping |
| `--hot-corners SPEC` | `tl=expose,br=showdesktop` | `corner=action` pairs, or `none` |

### The bar chips

Chips are native to the patched i3bar: it tracks the scratchpad over a new
`GET_SCRATCHPAD` IPC message (type 13, additive; scripts can use it too)
and renders one chip per minimized window next to the workspace buttons.
psychod restores the saved geometry whenever a chip brings a window back.

## 5. Behavior differences from stock i3

Complete list. Everything not listed behaves exactly like i3.

1. **Floating windows get titlebar buttons** (close / iconify / maximize)
   drawn in your titlebar text color. Tiled windows are untouched.
2. **Double-clicking a floating titlebar** toggles fullscreen (stock i3:
   starts a drag with no click action).
3. **Dragging a floating window to a workarea edge** shows a snap preview
   and snaps on drop (stock i3: plain move).
4. **Minimized windows get taskbar chips in i3bar** (app icons, urgency
   blink, click to restore) and the outline-box genie on minimize/restore.
   `psycho_chips no` and `psycho_genie_duration 0` restore stock rendering.
5. **`WM_CHANGE_STATE` Iconic requests are honored** and move the window to
   the scratchpad. Stock i3 rejects them (in-app minimize buttons do
   nothing there). Unmanaged windows still get the stock reject.
6. **Scratchpad windows carry `_NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN`** and ICCCM
   `WM_STATE` Iconic while hidden (stock i3: WITHDRAWN and no hidden
   state). Pagers and taskbars can tell minimized windows apart.
7. **Floating repositions emit `window::move` IPC events** (stock i3 emits
   none; this one is a candidate upstream patch).
8. With the shipped config: **new windows float by default** via
   `for_window [tiling] floating enable` — plain config, remove the line
   for stock behavior.

Vanilla i3 configs run unmodified. The IPC protocol is unchanged and only
extended by events that did not fire before.

## 6. Performance notes

- Build with `--buildtype=release` (the build script and PKGBUILD do).
  Meson's default is a debug build and it is visibly slower.
- `dist/picom.conf` is an intentionally invisible compositor config:
  vsync only, every eye-candy feature off. Use it if you see tearing
  during drags; skip it entirely on a well-behaved driver.
- Measured end-to-end action latency (tick to geometry applied) in a
  2-core build container: 1.9 ms mean, 3.0 ms max.

## 7. Troubleshooting

- **Something ignores my keybind:** psychod not running? Check
  `pgrep -af psychod`, and `i3-msg -t send_tick psycho:snap:left` to test
  the pipeline without keybindings.
- **psychod logs:** it writes to stderr, which lands in i3's log. Run
  `i3 --moreversion` to confirm you are on the patched binary, and use
  `DISPLAY=:0 psychod` in a terminal to watch it live.
- **Windows spawn centered, not cascaded:** the daemon is not connected;
  see above.
- **A window snapped with a small gap at the bottom:** its size hints
  (terminal character cells) round the size down. Keyboard/daemon snapping
  honors hints like every WM; the fork's drag-snap is exact.
- **Bug reports:** include `i3 --moreversion`, your config, and
  `/tmp/psychod-*.lock` ownership. The i3 debug log workflow
  (`i3-dump-log`) works unchanged.

## 8. FAQ

**Is this a fork?** A 4-patch series on upstream i3 master, rebased per
release, plus a daemon that any stock i3 can also run (with graceful
degradation). The i3-gaps model.

**Wayland?** No. This is X11, like i3. A Wayland i3psycho would be a sway
patch series, which is a different project.

**Can I keep tiling?** Yes. `$mod+t` returns any window to the tree, and
every tiling feature is intact. i3psycho is a superset.

**Why is the UI so plain?** On purpose. The blue titlebar is sacred, and
there are no shadows, no rounded corners, no animations: that is the i3
aesthetic, and it is frozen by decree of the project.
